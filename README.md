# CraigslistWebScraper

A fun project to learn some python/html and tkinter

# Warnings

1. Make sure what you want to search for is in lower case or else the program will bug. If you don't the program wont search for it correctly. It might also do something I have not discovered yet
2. I Have discovered a bug where after you press specify and before the results appear if you click anything or move the window, the search will just stop and sit idle.

2. Web Scraping is against Craigslist TOS so dont get angry at me if you get banned.

# Notice
This project is in a useable state but is far from polished.
