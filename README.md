# CraigslistWebScraper

A fun project to learn some python/html and tkinter

# Warnings

1. Make sure what you want to search for is in lower case or else the program will bug. If you don't the program wont search for it correctly. It might also do something I have not discovered yet

2. Web Scraping is against Craigslist TOS so dont get angry at me if you get banned.

# Notice
This project is not done, and is subject to change. If you wish to currently run this project download each python file except for `GUI.py` and inside of the file, `SpecifySearch.py`, change `SEARCH_ITEM` to `input()`
